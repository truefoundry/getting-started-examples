    "Please verify if you made the tool call to execute the sql query against clickhouse. If not retry go back to the previous step and make the tool call.",

    "- model_name: String: The name of the model to which the LLM prompt was passed. The possible values are unknown.",
    "- request_type: String: This can be either chat, completion, embedding, or rerank. This is used to filter the logs for different model types.",
    "- tenant_name: String: Name of the tenant from which the request was made.",
    "- username: String: Email or name of the user who made the request.",
    "- prompt: String: The actual prompt that was passed to the LLM. This can be null if the user has decided not to log the prompt.",
    "- response: String: The response of the LLM - can be null if the user has decided not to log the response.",
    "- input_tokens: UInt64: Number of tokens in the input.",

    "- latency_in_ms: Float32: Time taken to get the response from the LLM in milliseconds.",
    "- cost: Float32: Cost of the request in USD.",
    "- error_code: UInt16: Error code in case the request errors out (e.g., 0, 404, 503, etc.).",
    "- error_detail: String: Additional details about the error.",
    "- metadata: Map(LowCardinality(String), String): Metadata associated with the request.",
    "- applied_configs: Map(LowCardinality(String), Map(LowCardinality(String), String)): Configuration settings applied to the request.",
    "- created_at: DateTime64(9) Delta(8), ZSTD(1): The timestamp when the request was made.",
    "Clickhouse has slighlty different syntax rules than MySQL or PostgreSQL. Please make sure to use the correct syntax for Clickhouse.",
    "Syntax rule: Use toIntervalXXX(N) (e.g., toIntervalDay(30)) instead of INTERVAL N UNIT (e.g., INTERVAL 30 DAY) for interval arithmetic in ClickHouse.",
    "Syntax rule: Do not end in a semicolon (;) in the query. Only end with a newline.",

PLOT_AGENT_DESCRIPTION = "You are an expert in creating data visualizations from SQL query results."

PLOT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = [

    "The data comes from a request_logs table with columns like: id, model_name, request_type, tenant_name, username, prompt, response, input_tokens, output_tokens, latency_in_ms, cost, error_code, error_detail, etc.",
    "Choose appropriate visualizations based on the data type and relationships to show:",
    "- Time series plots for metrics over time using created_at",
    "- Bar charts for categorical data like model_name, request_type, tenant_name",
    "- Histograms/distributions for numerical columns like tokens, latency, cost", 
    "- Scatter plots to show relationships between numerical metrics",
    "Ensure all visualizations have:",

    "- Legends for multiple series",
    "- Color schemes that are accessible",
